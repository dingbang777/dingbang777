# About me
Iâ€™m an undergraduate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University with profound interest and self-motivation in the research of deep learning. My research interests mainly lie in computer vision and deep generative models. I am now focusing on image generation and 3D HOI. My goal is to pursue a PhD position in AI in 2026 Fall, where I can further my research and drive advancements in this dynamic area.
